Introduction to Our Game Arcade Webpage

Hello everyone! We are Yanming and Tianren, and we are excited to introduce you to our game arcade webpage. 
Our webpage features three unique games that offer fun, challenge, and entertainment. Let's take a closer look at each game:

First Game: Chore Door Game:
This open-source game brings a fun twist to the classic door game genre.
Players will navigate through different doors, each with its own surprises and challenges.
It's a great game to test your luck and decision-making skills!

Second Game: Five in a Row:

Designed by Yanming, this strategic game will keep you on your toes!
The goal is simple: be the first to align five of your pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
While the win condition may seem straightforward, implementing the diagonal win condition was a coding challenge that took careful planning and testing.
Additionally, creating the chessboard itself to support the gameâ€™s mechanics was another complex coding task, as it involved setting up a dynamic board with various interactivities.
It's a game of strategy, planning, and outsmarting your opponent.

Third Game: Catch the Bugs:
Created by Tianren, Catch the Bugs is an engaging and fast-paced game.
Your mission is to catch as many bugs as you can while avoiding obstacles.
One of the challenges we faced was implementing smooth screen scrolling to keep up with the fast-paced action, ensuring an enjoyable and immersive gameplay experience.
It's a perfect game to test your reflexes and hand-eye coordination!
We hope you enjoy exploring and playing our games. Whether you prefer strategy, chance, or action, we have something for everyone. We are committed to continuously improving our games and your experience on our webpage, so please feel free to share your feedback with us.

Thank you for visiting our game arcade webpage. Let the games begin!
